Let's say you have a `client/foo.html` file. You can visit `/foo` in your browser and everything's great. Until one day, when you need to start displaying data from an API (or perhaps even a hosted database).

How will you do this? You're already fine with a plain old HTML file; you prefer Lancer over coverting everything to next.js/nuxt/etc. And doing it in a client-side JavaScript file means you lose SSR – and that may not even be an option if you can't expose API keys!

As it turns out, this is super easy to do in Lancer. Just add a `foo.server.js` file to your project:

```
client/
├─ foo.html
├─ foo.server.js
```

...with this content:

```js
export default async ({ locals }) => {
  locals.myData = await fetchFromSomeApi()
}
```

and that's it! This file (specifically, the **default export**) will now run before every request made to `/foo`, allowing you to use it in `foo.html`:

```html
<h1>Foo</h1>
<p>The weather today is \{{myData.weather}}</p>
```

## Usage in Client-Side JavaScript

But wait – there's more. Anything you export from `foo.server.js` is *automagically available* when you import it from a client-side js file:

```js
/* client/bar.server.js */
export async function getSomeData() {
  return await fetchFromSomeApi()
}
```

```html
<!-- client/bar.html -->
<h1>Bar Example</h1>
<script src="/example.js"></script>
```

```js
/* client/example.js */
import * as Rpc from './bar.server'

Rpc.getSomeData().then(x => console.log("Got data:", x))
```

Incredible, it works! But what's going on here?

Lancer **is not** importing server-side code into your client. Instead, it intercepts the import `from './bar.server'` and generates a small RPC file it its place. As a result, when you call `Rpc.getSomeData()`, you're not running server code; you're actually running a function that calls `fetch`!

Not only does this reduce boilerplate to a bare minimum, it also allows you to re-use data fetching functions across page load (the default export function) and client JS.
