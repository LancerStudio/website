Let's say you have a `client/foo.html` file. You can visit `/foo` in your browser and everything's great. Until one day, when you need to start displaying data from an API (or perhaps even a hosted database).

How will you do this? You're already fine with a plain old HTML file; you prefer Lancer over coverting everything to next.js/nuxt/etc. And doing it in a client-side JavaScript file means you lose SSR (and it may not even be an option if you can't expose API keys).

It turns out this is super easy in Lancer. Just add a `foo.server.js` file to your project:

```
client/
├── foo.html
├── foo.server.js
```

...with this content:

```js
export default async ({ locals }) => {
  locals.myData = await ...
}
```

and that's it! This file will now run before every request made to `/foo`, allowing you to use it in `foo.html`:

```html
<h1>Foo</h1>
<p>The weather today is @{{myData.weather}}</p>
```

## Usage in Client-Side JavaScript

But wait, there's more. Anything you export from `foo.server.js` is automagically available when you import it from a client-side js file!

```js
/* client/bar.server.js */
export async function getSomeData() {
  return await ...
}
```

```html
<!-- client/bar.html -->
<h1>Bar Example</h1>
<div id="myTarget"></div>
<script src="/example.js"></script>
```

```js
/* client/example.js */
import * as Rpc from './bar.server'
<!-- LAST TIME: -->
<!-- LAST TIME: -->
<!-- LAST TIME: -->
<!-- LAST TIME: -->
<!-- LAST TIME: -->
```
