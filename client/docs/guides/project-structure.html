Lancer has three primary folders:

- [`client/`](#the-client-folder) – where most, if not all, your HTML/JS/CSS content lives...
- [`public/`](#the-public-folder) – a public folder for static files, and...
- [`data/`](#the-data-folder) – where Lancer stores account data, temporary data, and website builds.

## The Client Folder

All your HTML, JS, and CSS content goes in the `client/` folder. How you arrange them is 100% up to you.

The structure of your `client/` folder determines what pages are available on your website. For example, take the following files:

```
client/
├── _layout.html
├── index.html
├── blog.html
├── blog/
    ├── post-1.html
    ├── post-2.html
```

This directory structure will respond to the following URL mappings:

- `/` -> `client/index.html`
- `/blog` -> `client/blog.html`
- `/blog/post-1` -> `client/blog/post-1.html`
- `/_layout` -> **404**

Note the last request. Any html file that starts with an underscore (`_`) will not be available as a page.

### JavaScript and CSS

JS and CSS files follow the same rules. Any `.js` or `.css` file is available by default. Take the following example:

```
client/
├── index.html
├── foo.js
├── _bar.js
├── global.css
```

- A request to `/foo.js` will succeed.
- A request to `/_bar.js` will fail.
- However, `foo.js` is free to `import {whatever} from './_bar.js`, because Lancer bundles `foo.js` automatically.

### JavaScript and CSS Bundling

Lancer automatically bundles JS and CSS files within your `client/` folder using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org). You get bundling, minifying, and npm installs for free – no configuration required.

For JavaScript, use the standard `import` syntax:

```js
import 'alpinejs'
import React from 'react'
import { stuff } from './_bar.js'
```

For CSS, use the standard `@import` syntax:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

In development, these files are bundled on-the-fly. In production, you should use `lancer build` to generate more optimized assets.

## The Public Folder

All files in `public/` are made publically available. These files **do not** get any special treatment by Lancer – they get served as-is.

## The Data Folder

`data/` is a folder where Lancer writes a lot of internal data and caching. You should never commit this folder to git. Overviewing briefly:

- `data/cache/` is where cache data goes (safe to delete at anytime)
- `data/cache/build/` is where your build files go after running `lancer build`

Other than `data/cache/build/`, you probably won't have to interact with this folder.
