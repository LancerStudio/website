Lancer provides simple site-wide configuration via a `site.config.js` file in your project's root folder. It looks something like this:

```js
export default {
  name: "My Website",
  static: false,
  origin: 'https://example.com',
  locales: ['en'],
}

```

In this file you can specify several options, listed below.

## static

When `static` is set to true, running `lancer build` will generate a full static website.

## locals

There is often common logic you will need to access throughout your pages. The `locals` property is a good way to make functions and values available:

```js
  locals: {
    myGlobalVariable: 'https://other.example.com',
    myGlobalFunction(string) {
      return '#' + string
    }
  },

```

With this, you now use the interpolation syntax `\{{}}` to make use of them:

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum \{{ myGlobalFunction('dolor') }}</p>
```

### Local modules

Don't think you have to define them inline! It's easy to expose an entire module instead:

```js
import * as Links from './lib/links'

export default {
  // ...
  locals: {
    Links
  }
}
```

## templateTypes

Although Lancer is html-based, that doesn't mean you can't have nice DSLs defined in your markup.

Use the `templateTypes` to support `<template>` tags with any type string you want:

```js
export default {
  // ...
  templateTypes: {
    'fancy-snippet'(templateBodyHtml, attrs) {
      return renderCodeEditor(templateBodyHtml, attrs.lang)
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in any html file:


```html
<template type="fancy-snippet" lang="rust">
 fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
  }
<//template>
```

See [Markdown Support](/docs/guides/markdown-support) for a full example.

## bundleAliases

Lancer uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to bundle your JS files. Although extremely fast, one downside is some modules are not compatible with the browser, due to node.js specific dependencies.

Fortunately, open source devs have written js-only version of many of these dependencies.

You can use `bundleAliases` to re-map these imports to their browser-compatible counterparts. For example:

```js
export default {
  // ...
  bundleAliases: {
    'path': 'npm:path-browserify'
  }
}
```

With this, any attempts to import `path` in a JS bundle will now import `path-browserify` instead.
