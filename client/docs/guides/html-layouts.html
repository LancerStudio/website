# {{page.title}}

Single html files are great, but more often than not you're going to need common content across many pages.

Lancer generates your project with a simple layout file. The concepts you need to know are:

- The `<page>` tag
- The `<yield>` tag
- The `<content-for>` tag

## The \<page> Tag

`<page>` is a component that you will have on nearly every page in your project. Let's start with the simplest example:

```html
<!-- client/_layout.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>\{{ page.title }}</title>
<yield>

<!-- client/index.html -->
<page title="Home Page">
<h1>Home</h1>
```

Here's the final HTML this generates:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Home Page</title>
<h1>Home</h1>
```

In this example, the presence of the `<page>` tag in `client/index.html` causes Lancer to:

- Automatically use `client/_layout.html` as the page's layout file
- Assign `title` to the `page` object
- Inject all content into the `<yield>` tag in the layout file.

## Layout Files

Simply having a `<page>` tag will tell Lancer to use your `client/_layout.html` file. However, you can also specify **which** layout file you want to use:

```html
<page layout="/_other_layout.html" title="Example">
```

Files in the `layout` attribute are file paths relative to the `client/` folder.

## Nested Layouts

It's possible to have a layout use another layout file. Here's an example:

```html
<!-- client/_layout.html -->
<title>\{{ page.title }} | My Website</title>
<yield>

<!-- client/_blog-layout.html -->
<page title="\{{page.title}} | Blog">
<div class="blog-wrapper">
  <yield>
</div>

<!-- client/posts/post-1.html -->
<page title="Post 1" layout="/_blog-layout.html">
<h1>Post 1</h1>
<p>some content</p>
```

This generates the final HTML:

```html
<title>Post 1 | Blog | My Website</title>
<div class="blog-wrapper">
  <h1>Post 1</h1>
  <p>some content</p>
</div>
```
