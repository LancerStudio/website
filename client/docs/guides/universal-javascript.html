<aside>This feature is **experimental** and currently only works with Mithril.js. More framework support coming soon â€“ [create an issue](https://github.com/LancerStudio/lancer/issues) to expediate your favorite!</aside>

Lancer's flagship feature is being as close to plain HTML as possible, allowing you to learn and rely on knowledge you can use *anywhere*. However, sometimes you just need a fancy UI with dynamic API querying, and plain HTML just won't cut it.

Fortunately, Lancer has a great solution. It turns out the `<include>` tag has a second, more advanced usage: JavaScript SSR & hydration!

Let's say you have an html file that looks like this:

```html
<page title="Universal JavaScript Example">
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<include src="greeter.js" args="{ name: 'Alice' }">
```

Notice how we're using `<include>` for a **.js** file instead of a .html file! And also note how we're passing in data via the `args` attribute.

Now let's look at `client/greeter.js`, the file we're including:

```js
import m from 'mithril'

const MyComponent = {
  view({ attrs }) {
    return m('div', `Welcome, ${attrs.name}!`)
  }
}

// The cool stuff!
export default function mount({ dom, args }) {
  if (dom) {
    m.mount(dom, MyComponent)
  }
  else {
    return m(MyComponent, { name: args.name })
  }
}
```

And that's it! Lancer will run your .js file twice:

1. On the server to generate HTML (this is when `dom` in `function mount` is null)
2. On the client via a generated `script` tag to run on page load for user interactivity ðŸ˜Ž (this is when `dom` in `function mount` is present)
