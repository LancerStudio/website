<aside>This feature currently only works with Mithril.js. More framework support coming soon â€“ [create an issue](https://github.com/LancerStudio/lancer/issues) to expediate your favorite!</aside>

Lancer's flagship feature is being as close to plain HTML as possible, allowing you to learn and rely on knowledge you can use *anywhere*. However, sometimes you just need a fancy UI with dynamic API querying, and plain HTML just won't cut it.

Fortunately, Lancer has a great solution. It turns out the `<include>` tag has a second, more advanced usage: JavaScript SSR & hydration!

Let's say you have a `client/greeter.js` file that looks like this:

```js
import m from 'mithril'

export default {
  view({ attrs }) {
    return m('div', `Welcome, ${attrs.name}!`)
  }
}
```

In an html file you can write:

```html
<page title="Example">
<h1>Universal JavaScript</h1>
<include src="greeter.js" args="{ name: 'Alice' }">
```

and you've got it! Lancer will automatically generate HTML using your greeter component, and also generate & include a client-side js file to run on page load for user interactivity ðŸ˜Ž
