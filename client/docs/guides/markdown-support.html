# {{page.title}}

Just because Lancer is html-first doesn't mean you have to give up nice writing formats like Markdown.

Instead of inventing a new syntax or file type, Lancer gives you access to a simple, yet extremely powerful concept: **Custom `<template>` tags**.

Let's look at an example. Say you have this html file:

```html
<page title="My Page With Markdown">

<template type="markdown">
# Blog: \{{page.title}}

This is just a plain old `<template>` tag. *Super* cool!
<//template>
```

Note the `type="markdown"`. Lancer does not have special support for markdown, but it *does* allow you to transform template content!

All you need to do is specify the transform in your `site.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: "My Site",
  // ...
  templateTypes: {
    markdown: require('marked')
  }
}
```

And that's it! Lancer will feed the content of your templates (with `type="markdown"`) into your `templateTypes.markdown` function, and replace it with the output of that function. In this case you'll get:

```html
<!doctype html>
<h1>Blog: My Page With Markdown</h1>

<p>This is just a plain old <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag. <i>Super</i> cool!</p>
```

Again, this isn't markdown specific; you can specify any template type you want and use it in your code. Have fun with it!

</template>
