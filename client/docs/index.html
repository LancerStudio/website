# Welcome, Developer

<div class="-mt-6 text-3xl text-gray-600 font-light">You've arrived at Lancer Studio.</div>

Gone are the days of spaghetti boilerplate, unintuitive syntaxes, and messy configuration files. You're about to learn a better way to develop websites.

To better understand the benefits, here are some core principles Lancer adheres to:

- Content **always** starts with an html file. No special file types.
- No new syntaxes. Use the HTML you already know and love.
- Automatic, no-config JavaScript and CSS bundling.
- Intuitive server-side JavaScript when you need it.

To get started with Lancer, check out the [Installation](/docs/guides/installation) and [Project Structure](/docs/guides/project-structure) doc pages.
