# Welcome, Developer

<div class="-mt-6 text-3xl text-gray-600 font-light">You've arrived at Lancer Studio.</div>

Gone are the days of spaghetti boilerplate, unintuitive syntaxes, and messy configuration files. You're about to learn a better way to develop websites.

<aside>Lancer is currently in **alpha**. It works great for what it does, but some useful features are still missing.</aside>

To better understand how and why, here are some core principles Lancer adheres to:

- Content **always** starts with an html file. No special file types to learn or remember.
- No new syntaxes. Use the HTML you already know and love.
- Automatic, no-config JavaScript and CSS bundling.
- Intuitive server-side JavaScript when you need it.

To get started with Lancer, check out the [Installation](/docs/guides/installation) and [Project Structure](/docs/guides/project-structure) doc pages.

## When Should You Use Lancer?

Lancer is ideal for content-based websites. This includes websites such as:

- Landing / marketing websites
- Documentation websites
- Company websites
- Personal blogs

Lancer DOES NOT cater to fully-JS-rendered apps. If you're building a full-fledged web app, I suggest using Lancer for your landing, marketing, about, etc. pages, and then something like Ruby on Rails or Next.js for your heavy application code on an `app.example.com` subdomain.
