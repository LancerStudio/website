# Welcome to Lancer

<div class="-mt-6 text-3xl text-gray-600 font-light">Let's build content websites together.</div>

## Quick Start

To create a project from scratch:

```
$ mkdir my-proj && cd my-proj
$ npm init -y
$ npm install @lancer/studio
$ npx lancer init all
$ npm run dev
```

Now visit [localhost:7272](http://localhost:7272) to view your new project.

## Core Concepts

Here are some core principles Lancer adheres to:

- Content **always** starts with an html file. No special file types to learn or remember.
- No new syntaxes. Use the HTML you already know and love, plus basic interpolation brackets.
- Automatic, no-config JavaScript and CSS bundling.
- Intuitive server-side JavaScript when you need it.

To get started with Lancer, check out the [Project Structure](/docs/guides/project-structure) doc page.

## When Should You Use Lancer?

Lancer is ideal for content-based websites. This includes websites such as:

- Landing / marketing websites
- Documentation websites
- Company websites
- Personal blogs

Lancer DOES NOT cater to fully-JS-rendered apps. If you're building a full-fledged web app, I suggest using Lancer for your landing, marketing, about, etc. pages, and then something like Ruby on Rails or Next.js for your heavy application code on an `app.example.com` subdomain.
