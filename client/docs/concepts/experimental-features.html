<aside>The following features are experimental. They are highly likely to change!</aside>

Lancer is revolutionizing the way we build content websites. Below are some features currently being worked on.

## Dynamic Image Resizing

For any image file in your `data/files` directory, you can request a resized version of that image quite easily. Great for image galleries or responsive image definitions.

For example, to create a gallery preview image definition, you can put this in your `site.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  name: 'My App',
  // ...

  //
  // See resize options here: https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize#resize
  //
  imagePreviews: sharp => ({
    myGalleryDef: {
      width: 360,
      height: 240,
      fit: sharp.fit.outside,
    },
  })
}
```

Now, assuming you have an image file in `data/files/my-page/my-image.jpg`, you can request a smaller size like so:

```html
<img src="/files/my-page/my-image.jpg?preview=myGalleryDef" />
```

And that's it! Lancer will generate and cache the image for you in `data/cache`.

## Internationalization (i18n)

<aside>This is a freelance feature.</aside>

Lancer gives your freelance client a super-easy way to edit translations on their website.

To start, just use the `<t>` tag in your html. For example:

```
<t>home.header.title</t>
```

The server will render this on the page, and make it editable if you're signed in. Simply **alt-click** the text and a textarea will appear on the screen.

`hreflang` attributes are added according to [Google's recommendations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions)
