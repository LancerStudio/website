Lancer is revolutionizing the way we build content websites. Here is Lancer's short to medium term plan.

### Dynamic Routing

Lancer's current routing system is completely directory based. While very convenient, it doesn't cover the common use case of mapping a dynamic url to an html file, such as the following example:

```
GET /user/alice -> client/user.html
GET /user/bob   -> client/user.html
```

Perhaps taking [Next.js's dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) idea is appropriate here.

### Structured Content

Freelance feature. The "headless CMS" feature is a broken concept that unnecessarily decouples website content from the website itself, increasing code complexity and making it hard to hunt for the content you or your client want to change.

Having editable, structured content should be as easy as writing some html. Lancer will have structured content as easy as the `<t>` tag in its [i18n feature](/docs/concepts/experimental-features#internationalization-i18n).

### Encrypted secrets manager

Freelance feature. Every website eventually has a need to share secrets, from account passwords to API keys. Instead of forcing your freelance client to create yet another account, Lancer will have a secure way of secret sharing built in.
