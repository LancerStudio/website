There's no better feeling than starting a fresh, greenfield project. New horizons, cleaner code, great potential – **no legacy code**!

But eventually – almost inevitably – the project becomes a drag to work on. You know the feeling. The hesitance. The reluctance. The *dread*.

Why does this happen? Is it truly inevitable? How do we avoid it? *Can* we avoid it?

## It all crept up on us

As web developers, there's no debate our tools have gotten more complicated over time.

I started web development in 2007. Over the course of these 14 years, I've seen:

- The industry go from jQuery to heavy client JavaScript to full-on Single Page Applications
- The increasing complexity and compile times of build tools (once called "transpilers")
- The crazy configuration of bundling tools (<3 to browserify for staying simple)
- The modern shoehorning of apps into serverless/kubernetes/etc, making deployment incredibly more complex.

Granted, some of this was necessary to push the web forward. But now that browsers have all implemented modern HTML and have caught up on JavaScript features, it's time to reevaluate. Do we really need all this complexity?
